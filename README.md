Speech Recognition System

This is a simple speech recognition project built using Python. The goal of this project is to take voice input from a microphone, convert it to text, and display the recognized text on the screen. It's a great starting point for beginners who want to explore voice-based applications.

What This Project Does

* Captures audio through the microphone
* Converts spoken words into text using Google's Speech Recognition API
* Displays the recognized text in the console
* Optional: Converts text back to speech using a text-to-speech engine

Tools and Technologies Used

* Python
* SpeechRecognition library
* PyAudio (for microphone access)
* gTTS (for optional text-to-speech)
* playsound (to play the spoken response)

How to Set Up

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:


pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install PyAudio
pip install gTTS
pip install playsound


3. Run the Python script (e.g., `main.py`) to start the system.

 How It Works

* When the program runs, it will ask you to speak into the microphone.
* Your voice will be recorded and sent to Google's API for processing.
* The recognized text will be printed on the screen.
* If text-to-speech is enabled, the system will also read the text out loud.

 Possible Use Cases

* Voice-controlled applications
* Personal assistants
* Voice-to-text note-taking
* Accessibility tools for people with disabilities

 Future Improvements

* Add offline recognition support
* Build a simple GUI for ease of use
* Add command-based automation features (e.g., opening apps with voice)
